# Project_1_Toys_and_models_Company_WCS

You are commissioned by a company selling models and scale models. The company already has a database that lists employees, products, orders, and much more. You are invited to browse and discover this database. The director of the company wishes to have a dashboard which he could refresh each morning to have the latest information in order to manage the company.

Objective

Your dashboard should revolve around these 4 main topics: sales, finance, logistics, and human resources.
Here are the indicators that should be present in your dashboard. Visualizations would also be appreciated. And you are invited to practice your advisory role, by proposing additional KPIs and charts.
Sales: The number of products sold by category and by month, with comparison and rate of change compared to the same month of the previous year.
Finances: 
The turnover of the orders of the last two months by country. 
Orders that have not yet been paid.
Logistics: The stock of the 5 most ordered products.
Human Resources: Each month, the 2 sellers with the highest turnover.

Nota bene: sometimes business indicators are not technically achievable. It is up to you to explain it, and to be a force of proposal to answer to the business needs.
